## Setup
For running the server and client code, you might need to run the program with arguments via the terminal.

First, use ```javac [MainClassName].java```.

Once the program has compiled, use ```java [MainClassName] <arg0> <arg1>``` .
Arg0 (and sometimes arg1) are usually the portNumber and in case of the server the hostname 
```java MainServer <hostname> <port>```
```java Client <port>```
